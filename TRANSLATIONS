If you would like to contribute new translations for dotnew, or fix an
existing translation, please use the dotnew project at transifex.net at
the following address:
https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/dotnew/

For existing translations, you can just go ahead and translate online
using the transifex web interface.

For new translations, you will need to get the dotnew.pot file from the
project page and create a .po file for your language from it. You can
use a tool like poedit for that purpose (http://www.poedit.net/)
