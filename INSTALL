You can just copy the dotnew script into /usr/sbin or somewhere
in your PATH and make sure it has execution permissions.

Alternatively, if you want to have localisation for dotnew, you can
use two simple scripts that are in the same directory as this README
file, compile.sh and install.sh. The first one will compile the .mo
localisation files that come with dotnew in the locale directory and the
second one installs all files in the system. You'll need to have root
permissions to install files in your system. install.sh accepts a
$DESTDIR variable to install in an arbitrary directory (that helps in
packaging for example). You can use it like this:

DESTDIR=/path/to/installation/directory install.sh
