You can just copy the dotnew script into /usr/sbin or somewhere
in your PATH and make sure it has execution permissions.

Alternatively, if you want to have localisation for dotnew, you can
use two simple scripts that are in the same directory as this README
file, compile.sh and install.sh. The first one will compile the .mo
localisation files that come with dotnew in the locale directory and the
second one installs all files in the system. You'll need to have root
permissions to install files in your system. install.sh accepts a
$DESTDIR variable to install in an arbitrary directory (that helps in
packaging for example). You can use it like this:

DESTDIR=/path/to/installation/directory install.sh

If you want to have dotnew translated in your language, you can just get
the dotnew.pot file that is in the locale directory and run:

msginit -i dotnew.pot -o yourlocale.po

That will create a .po file which is just a text file that you can edit
with any text editor. The text that needs to be translated is in msgid
strings and your translation for each should be written in the msgstr
strings for each message like this:

msgid "Text to be translated"
msgstr "Translation of the above text"

When you translate everything in the .po file you can send me your
translation at vlahavas~at~gmail~dot~com and I'll make sure to add it in
the next version of dotnew.
