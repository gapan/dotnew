dotnew is a utility to help the user manage system configuration files
in slackware and slackware based distributions.

dotnew uses Xdialog or dialog (if you are running under X11 or in a
linux console respectively) to present the user with a menu for each
new configuration file present in his system. The user is allowed to:

- replace the old configuration file with the new one
- delete the new configuration file
- view a diff between the old and new configuration files
- run vimdiff between the old and new configuration files
