dotnew is a utility to help the user manage system configuration files
in slackware and slackware based distributions.

dotnew provides both console and graphical interfaces. The console
interface uses dialog to present the user with a menu for each new
configuration file present in his system. The graphical interface is
using the GTK+3 toolkit. The user is allowed to:

- replace the old configuration file with the new one
- delete the new configuration file
- view a diff between the old and new configuration files
- merge differences between the old and new configuration files using a
  selection of optional tools. These include vim, neovim, meld, diffuse,
  kompare, kdiff3, xxdiff and tkdiff.
